   Yo! My name is Jeancarlos Salazar and im A 18yr old exploring the world bit by bit. Lately i've been putting myself out there more and giving new experiences a whirl. I like to spent my time either playing sports with my friends, watching/reading pieces of fiction that peaks my interst. Movies such as Scott Pilgrim Vs The World, Pulp Fiction, and any movie involving Spider-Man to name a few. I'd like to think of myself as a introverted extrovert because i can come off as introverted but if you hang around me long enough you'll see my shell start to crack. I live with my mom and its really just been us 2 against all odds and i am grateful to have such a commutative, understanding, open minded relationship with my parent and can't imagine life without her but, i know nothing last forever so i live life trying to enjoy every minute of it. speaking with logic then wasting my breath and time arguing over nonsense is a practice that i use in my everyday life that i wish a lot more people could part-take in it. I tend not to dwell to much on my future. And i'd say thats one of my biggest weakness but, i do know that i don't want to work until i die (biggest nightmare).I want to learn more about things that can benefit me not just financially but realistically such as life skills(trades,driving,cooking etc).
